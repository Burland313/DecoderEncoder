# DecoderEncoder
 Application used to encode and decode messages using various types of ciphers. 
 Currently implemented ciphers:
 * Caesar Shift
 * Vigenere Cipher
## Getting Started
This is where instructions go. Once I learn how to work this thing
### Installing
Once I learn how to set up this project to install I will fill this out
